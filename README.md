# Guess the Number Game (Java)

This program is a "Guess the Number" game made in Java. It's designed to help understand Java's object-oriented programming features, like inheritance and abstraction, while also practicing basic input and output.

The game involves the computer generating a random number between 1 and 100, which the player must guess within a limited number of attempts.

This project aims to demonstrate and reinforce the use of extends and abstract in Java while showcasing the concepts of encapsulation and abstraction through an engaging and interactive application.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
